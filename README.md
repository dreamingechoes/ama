# AMA

A repository to ask [@dreamingechoes](https://twitter.com/dreeamingechoes) anything.

I'm a Software Developer from the north of Spain, interested in all kind of technologies. 
I have been working as a software developer since 2005, starting with desktop application developments 
to quickly focus on my true passion: web development.

With years of experience developing projects of all kinds with Ruby and Rails, I am currently focused
on the Elixir/Phoenix duo. The other two fields of software that interest me most are the 
Internet of things and intelligent systems.

When I'm not working, I like to learn new technologies, write about software development 
[on my personal website](http://dreamingecho.es), take some photography and play the guitar.

If you have a question you're interested in reading me tap out a response for, this is just the right place.
